SQL Schema
/*

Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

--SOLUTION
#### Solution-1:
*  T-SQL query statement below
* I have used Left Join to solve this Problem, Where By Left Joining the Table, the result set is obtained. 

```
select c.name as Customers
from customers as c left join orders as o
on c.id = o.customerId
where o.customerId is null
```
#### Solution-2:
* We can use the not in operator to solve this problem

```
SELECT name AS Customers FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM ORDERS);
```


#### Solution-3:
* We can also use the, Minus Operator to solve this problem.

```
select name as Customers 
from CUSTOMERS 
Where id in (SELECT id FROM CUSTOMERS minus SELECT customerId FROM ORDERS);
```
