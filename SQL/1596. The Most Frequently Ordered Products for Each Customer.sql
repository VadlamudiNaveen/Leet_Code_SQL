Write an SQL query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+-------+
| customer_id | name  |
+-------------+-------+
| 1           | Alice |

| 4           | Jerry |
| 5           | John  |
+-------------+-------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+

| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 3          | screen       |
| 3           | 3          | screen       |
| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.
